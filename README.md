# Combined-Power-Plants-Energy-Output-Prediction-Using-Decision-tree
Decision Tree Regression approach in order to predict the target variable using a combined cycle power plants dataset.  A Decision Tree model formulates a series of inquiries to come up with the best decision, based on the features present in the training set. In this report, the process of how the decision tree turns a regression model into a tree structure and how it deals with feature and target variables is shown. It evaluates the metrics which represent the accuracy rate of the model. This project will explore visual representation and connections between the variables.
